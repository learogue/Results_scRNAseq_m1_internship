# Results on the embryoid bodies pharmacologically induced

In `DEG`, ther is all the table of differential genes expression.

`Analysis_Vrij.ipynb` is the notebook on the analysis without fix the standard.

`GO_Epi_down.pdf`, `GO_Epi_up.pdf`, `GO_PrE_down.pdf` and `GO_PrE_up.pdf` are dotplots on GO terms between EBs epiblast and embryo epiblast and the same for primitive endoderm.

`PrE_Venn.svg` and `Epi_Venn.svg` are Venn diagram to show number of genes.

`ingest_Vrij.ipynb` is the notebook on the analysis with the standard fixed.
