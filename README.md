# Results_scRNAseq_m1_internship
I use https://github.com/learogue/scRNAseq_project to construct a standard and test multiple parameters.
In Results_standard, there is plots on quality and filters of datasets. I can't put datas because of size. And there is also a jupyter notebook on the analysis of this standard with UMAP's and Volcano plot.
