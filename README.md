# Results_scRNAseq_m1_internship

In this repository, I put all my results of my m1 internship on the re-evaluation of transcriptome data in single cells of early mouse embryo.

I use https://github.com/learogue/scRNAseq_project to construct a standard and test multiple parameters.

In `Results_standard`, there is plots on quality and filters of datasets. I can't put datas because of size. And there is also a jupyter notebook on the analysis of this standard with UMAP's, Volcano plot and differential expression of genes.

In `Results_EBs`, there is results of analysis with embryoid bodies. This embryoid bodies are different because of the inudction : pharmacologically or genetically.

In `Appendix_scripts`, there are others scripts that I made to create plots.
