Here, there are all the results on the standard.

The folder `Pre_processing_plots` contains plots on datasets quality (`Filters`), the mapping quality in `MultiQC`, and plots on number of reads, genes and percentages of reads uniquely mapped.

The file `df_expression_left1pos_PrE_signif.tab` is the table of differential expression of genes of cells which expressed _Lefty1_ in the primitive endoderm compare to others cells of the primitive endoderm.

`standard_int.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook with all the command lines used for this analysis.
